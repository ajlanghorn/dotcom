After two and a half fun years at the [Government Digital
Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk) working as an infrastructure engineer on
the [GOV.UK](https://gov.uk) project, I decided recently that I needed to
spend some tiem seeing other stacks and working in other environments.

I've learned a heck of a lot whilst working at GDS, and I'm very grateful to
everyone who put their time and effort in to spending time with me, teaching
me things and showing me the slightly crazy world that is running a live
service which millions of people around the world rely on.

Aviation House was a fun place to work, and it's full of some utterly
incredible people doing a lot of hard work to make things look simple on the
outside to the people who matter most; our users. They do this not by
putting their needs first, or the needs of their stakeholders first, but by
realising that there is one true eventual stakeholder: the user.

I've joined [ThoughtWorks](https://thoughtworks.com), a software
consultancy, in their Manchester office, and am looking forward to seeing
what I can learn, and working with some of their clients as my career
progresses.

Thank you, GDS: it was fun. Keep up the good work!
