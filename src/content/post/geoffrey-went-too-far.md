I saw [Public Service Broadcasting](https://twitter.com/psbhq) last night at
one of my favourite venues in Manchester, the [Albert
Hall](http://alberthallmanchester.com). They played the entirety of [The
Race to
Space](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Race-Space-Public-Service-Broadcasting/dp/B00PITV84K)
with a string quintet, thirteen-piece choir and a brass section from the
[RNCM](http://rncm.ac.uk). It was previously suggested that they'd never
play the album in entirety live, because of the sensitive nature of [_Fire
In The Cockpit_](https://play.spotify.com/track/0JFrJwJ5chcp66dgnFuoiJ); the
real fire in the cockpit of [Apollo
1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1_disaster) in 1967.

Before coming out, they played their
own public information film warning of the dangers of filming at gigs,
annoying other gig-goers and generally being an arse with an iPad out for
the entire duration of the set. Imagine if this was mandatory viewing before all gigs.
