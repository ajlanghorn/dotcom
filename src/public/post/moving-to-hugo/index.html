				<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly active when it comes to blogging, and I often wonder
whether or not half of the reason for this is because my existing blog takes
an age and a half to deploy once I&rsquo;ve written a post.</p>

<p>For this reason, many posts end up either in draft form and never published,
or as heavily condensed tweetstorms, curated perfectly (of course!) for my
legion of followers.</p>

<p>Back in the day, this blog used to run on WordPress, but as times
progressed, I wondered why exactly I did need a relation database holding
all of my posts, and really what use I was getting out of all the additional
cruft it ships with. It&rsquo;s
<a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-2337/product_id-4096/">vulnerabilities</a>
weren&rsquo;t too appealing, either.</p>

<p>So, then I moved to use Jekyll, and deployed it in to S3. This worked for a
while, but then I had to battle Ruby and some other internet beasts to get
the thing to work the way I wanted to. In the end, the process for
deployment was a little bit of hassle. However, I will say that Jekyll, and
Octopress (something else I tried for a while), are both significantly
better for my needs than WordPress was.</p>

<p>Since my needs are so light, I&rsquo;ve decided to move to
<a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. All I need is to
be able to write some words, run a command and have a static site built that
I can deploy anywhere. And partially, that last bit is why I chose Hugo;
because it&rsquo;s written in Golang, and therefore deployable most everywhere
under the sun.</p>
