				<p>After two and a half fun years at the <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk">Government Digital
Service</a> working as an infrastructure engineer on
the <a href="https://gov.uk">GOV.UK</a> project, I decided recently that I needed to
spend some tiem seeing other stacks and working in other environments.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a heck of a lot whilst working at GDS, and I&rsquo;m very grateful to
everyone who put their time and effort in to spending time with me, teaching
me things and showing me the slightly crazy world that is running a live
service which millions of people around the world rely on.</p>

<p>Aviation House was a fun place to work, and it&rsquo;s full of some utterly
incredible people doing a lot of hard work to make things look simple on the
outside to the people who matter most; our users. They do this not by
putting their needs first, or the needs of their stakeholders first, but by
realising that there is one true eventual stakeholder: the user.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve joined <a href="https://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>, a software
consultancy, in their Manchester office, and am looking forward to seeing
what I can learn, and working with some of their clients as my career
progresses.</p>

<p>Thank you, GDS: it was fun. Keep up the good work!</p>
