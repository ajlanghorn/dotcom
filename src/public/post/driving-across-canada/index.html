			<section itemprop="entry-text">
				<p>A few months ago, the possibility of driving from one side of Canada -
namely, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/SW6cZxaqufH2">Whistler</a> - to the other side -
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/QRHPZkkxNfr">Montreal</a>, in Quebec - was touted in front
of me. I&rsquo;d only ever previously been to Canada for a few short hops whilst
living in Detroit - either to Windsor, sometimes, or up to Toronto via the
Niagara Falls, so I was keen to give a coast-to-coast (or thereabouts) tour
a good go, and thought it would be great to see so many places at once. So,
I said yes, and booked some flights to Vancouver.</p>

<p>That was at the end of July, and we&rsquo;d finalised who was heading out to join
us for the two and a half week trip. My fellow drivers
(<a href="https://twitter.com/cbetta">Cristiano</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/kevinprince">Kevin</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/bpscott">Ben</a>) and I decided to start chalking up some
routes, and to investigate what we&rsquo;d need to actually do the trip in
reasonable comfort whilst also seeing all that Canada had to offer.</p>

<p>We plotted eight different, potentially feasible, routes across the country,
which we worked out would take us about ten days, via the USA:</p>

<p>We christened our rental car &lsquo;RV Ellipsis&rsquo;, a homage to the good ship
<a href="https://twitter.com/svellipsis">@svellipsis</a>, and set off with creating a
Twitter account, <a href="https://twitter.com/rv_ellipsis">@rv_ellipsis</a> to document our travels.</p>

<p>I think our Twitter account does a better job of noting what exactly
happened on our travels, so I won&rsquo;t recount it all here. And there are some
things better left for memories than written down anyway&hellip;</p>

<p>In the end, the route we took looked a little different to one we&rsquo;d planned,
but was approximately the same:</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s about 5,000 miles, covered in approximately ten days, pretty much
from coast to coast. Suffice to say that the only hiccup we had was a car
scraped across three panels when I was trying to navigate a small Montreal
car park in a big nine-seater Toyota Higlander&hellip;</p>

<p>Thanks, Canada. You were great fun! Maybe see you again soon.</p>
